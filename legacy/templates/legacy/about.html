        About "Byte of Legacy"
        <p class="bol-about-statements">
            Byte of Legacy is more than a digital wall — it’s a living mosaic of stories, memories, and dreams. Each byte you claim is a meaningful mark on our collective startup journey.

        Our Vision
        <p class="bol-about-statements">
            We’re building a unique platform where individuals, friends, and supporters can eternally leave their legacy — a pixel-sized footprint on a bigger story. Unlike traditional fundraising, here you get to be part of an interactive art piece, permanently showcased for the world.
        </p>
        <p class="bol-about-statements">
            Your support fuels the growth of our startup, helping turn ideas into reality. In return, you gain not just a space on the wall, but a share in our story.
        </p>
