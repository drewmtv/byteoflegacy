        Our Vision
        <p class="bol-about-statements">
            We’re building a space where names, memories, jokes, and dedications live forever. Unlike traditional fundraising, your support becomes a permanent part of an interactive and visual story — a digital monument powered by people.
        </p>
        <p class="bol-about-statements">
            Every slot you claim helps fund the development of TechStart TV and future storytelling tools, experiences, and platforms for the innovation ecosystem.
